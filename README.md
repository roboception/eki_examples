# EKI-Examples

This repository provides example applications demonstrating how to integrate [Roboception](https://roboception.com)'s [rc_visard](https://roboception.com/rc_visard) 
or [rc_cube](https://roboception.com/product/rc_cube-s/) with KUKA robots using the EKI interface.

## Example Applications

* **CADMatch**: Demonstrates CAD-based object detection and pick-and-place operations
* **ItemPick**: Demonstrates continuous bin-picking for bags. Program loops until bin is empty, detecting items and trying available grasp poses for each detection
* **HandEyeCalibration**: Performs an 8-pose calibration routine to align camera and robot coordinate systems
* **AprilTag**: Implements AprilTag detection and robot positioning
* **Measure**: Demonstrates depth measurement and region analysis capabilities

Each example includes complete robot programs with error handling, integration with respective rc_reason modules, and basic motion sequences.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

Before running any example:

1. **EKI Configuration**:
   * Download the required EKI XML configuration files from the [rc_cube documentation](https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/eki.html#eki-xml-configuration-files) or [rc_visard documentation](https://doc.rc-visard.com/latest/en/eki.html#eki-xml-configuration-files)
   * Store all EKI XML files in `C:\KRC\ROBOTER\Config\User\Common\EthernetKRL` on the robot controller
   * Configure the IP address of your rc_visard or rc_cube in the EKI XML files
   * Ensure service names in the code match exactly with your EKI XML configuration files

2. **System Requirements**:
   * rc_visard or rc_cube with EKIBridge license
   * KUKA Robot Controller with KUKA.EthernetKRL

For detailed configuration instructions, refer to the [Ethernet connection configuration](https://doc.rc-cube.com/latest/en/eki.html#ethernet-connection-configuration) documentation.
